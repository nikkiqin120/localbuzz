## 💡 Need to Know: Practical Tips & Tricks!

1.  **Location & Getting There:**
    *   🚩 **Address:** 999 Canada Pl, Vancouver (Inside the Canada Place building with the white sails).
    *   🚇 **SkyTrain:** Super easy! Get off at **Waterfront Station** and it's just a 5-minute walk.
    *   🚗 **Driving:** Navigate to the **Canada Place underground parking**. Elevators take you right up – super convenient!
2.  **Hours & Booking:**
    *   ⏰ **Check **FlyOver Canada hours**:** They are typically open daily from **10:00 AM to 9:00 PM**, with shows running every 15-20 minutes. Always wise to confirm current times before you go!
    *   🎟️ **Tickets:** You can buy tickets on the [official website](https://www.flyovercanada.com/). **Book online in advance!** Seriously recommend this, especially for weekends, holidays, or peak season to avoid disappointment and potentially long lines.
    *   🌇 **Sunset Tip:** Booking a slot around dusk? You get the amazing ride PLUS stunning real-life sunset views over the harbour afterwards! Win-win!
