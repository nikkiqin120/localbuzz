## 🏔️ Mountain Highs: Gondolas & Views Galore!

The **Peak 2 Peak Gondola** experience is an absolute MUST-DO! It connects Whistler and Blackcomb mountains and offers jaw-dropping views. Here's the rundown:

1.  **Start at Whistler Village:** Park (Lot 1 is convenient) and grab your tickets for the **Whistler Village Gondola** 🚡 ($99+tax adult Day Pass usually covers everything, kids often free – check current prices!).
2.  **Ascend Whistler Mountain:** Ride up, snap pics with the iconic Olympic Rings ⭕️.
3.  **Peak Express Chairlift:** *Highly recommend* this open-air chairlift (min height ~1m)! It takes you higher for seriously stunning, "top-of-the-world" views, accessing the **Cloudraker Skybridge** (suspension bridge) and Raven's Eye lookout. Thrilling! 🤩
4.  **Peak 2 Peak Gondola:** Head back near the rings and hop on the legendary **PEAK 2 PEAK Gondola** 🚠. This marvel holds records for its span and height, offering incredible valley views as you glide between Whistler and Blackcomb mountains. VIP experience!
5.  **Explore Blackcomb:** Wander around Blackcomb, enjoy the alpine scenery, then ride the Blackcomb Gondola back down to the Upper Village or return via Peak 2 Peak.

## 🌲 Thrills & Unique Experiences

*   **Ziptrek Ecotours:** Feel the wind! We tried the **Sasquatch Line** – it's one of the longest ziplines in North America! Super fast (~100km/h) and exhilarating, soaring high above the Fitzsimmons Creek. It takes about an hour total, with over a minute of pure flight time! So fun! 🤣 There are other, longer tour options too.
*   **Scandinave Spa Whistler:** Pure bliss! ♨️ Just an 8-min drive from the Village. Cycle through their hot baths, Nordic waterfalls, cold plunges (try it!), eucalyptus steam room (amazing! 👌), and relaxation areas. Perfect way to unwind after a day of adventure. Remember the hot-cold-relax cycle! 💕
*   **Copper Cayuse Outfitters (Horse Riding):** A unique way to see the landscape! 🐎 Located about 30 mins drive from Whistler (towards Pemberton). We did an hour-long ride – my horse Ridge was so gentle! The scenery is beautiful, and it makes for fantastic photos. 📸

## ✨ Culture & Scenic Stops

*   **Audain Art Museum:** An architectural stunner in the Village! Even if you're not a huge art buff, the building itself is worth seeing (and photographing!). Features a fantastic collection of British Columbian art.
*   **Porteau Cove Provincial Park:** Driving the Sea-to-Sky Highway? **Definitely stop here!** 🌊 About halfway between Vancouver and Whistler, it's a gorgeous park right on Howe Sound. Perfect for picnics, photos, maybe spotting seals 🦭, or even a *very* refreshing dip in the ocean on a hot day! Pure natural beauty. ✨
*   **Olympic Park:** Check out the legacy of the 2010 Winter Games. Good for a wander and some photos.
*   **Vallea Lumina:** An enchanted multimedia night walk through the forest. It's a cool experience, especially for families, though maybe not mind-blowing.

## 🍴 Foodie Bites in the Village

*   **🥐 Provisions:** **MUST VISIT!** Expect queues, but worth it. Their cookies, pastries, and drinks are fantastic. The Sausage + Egg + Cheese sandwich is a winner! 🏆
*   **🍦 COWS Whistler:** Iconic Canadian ice cream! Creamy, delicious flavours, plus cute cow-themed merch. 🐄 Perfect treat after exploring.
*   **🍳 La Brasserie:** Solid brunch spot! Good food, but be prepared for a potential 30-min wait for your meal. ⏳
*   **🍜 Quick & Easy:** **Mongolie Grill** (pay-by-weight stir-fry, good if you're starving) or **Ohyama Ramen** (decent ramen fix). There's also a supermarket in the village for snacks/supplies (slightly pricier than city supermarkets).
*   **(Skip?) Bar Oso:** We found it pricey for tiny tapas portions. Maybe better for drinks/atmosphere than a full meal if you're hungry or with kids.
