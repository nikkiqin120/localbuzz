Hey everyone! 👋

So, we all know Vancouver spring = cherry blossoms 🌸, right? And yeah, they're *amazing*! But guess what? There's ANOTHER flower explosion happening around the same time, and honestly, it's just as gorgeous (and maybe even more colorful!): **TULIPS!** 🌷

If you're looking for some serious color therapy after the grey winter months, you're in luck. Several amazing tulip festivals are popping up in and around Greater Vancouver for 2025. Forget just sticking to the city – these fields are worth the little road trip!

Here's the lowdown on the main events you won't want to miss:

## 1. Abbotsford Tulip Festival (Lakeland Flowers at Maan Farms)

*   **When?** Pencil this in: **April 5th to mid-May, 2025**. They're open daily! The millions of tulips are expected to start blooming right around that opening date.
*   📍 **Location:** Head out to **Maan Farms** at **790 McKenzie Rd, Abbotsford, BC**. (The festival itself is presented by Lakeland Flowers, happening at this location).
*   **What's the big deal?** Okay, get this: **35 ACRES** of tulips! We're talking over **10 MILLION** bulbs and more than **100 different varieties**. 🤯 Seriously! They've got kilometers of walking paths winding through the fields. You'll see tons of different types, including some super cool special varieties imported straight from the Netherlands, like **fringed tulips** and **double tulips**. They even have a special 'legacy' tulip named after the owner Nick's father, Peter Warmerdam. How sweet is that? This festival kicks off Lakeland Flowers' whole flower season (they'll have peonies, lupins, meadows, and lavender later in May/June!).
*   **Tickets?** Definitely **buy online ahead of time** to save some cash!
    *   **Weekdays (Mon-Fri):** $8 (online day before), $10 (online same-day), $12 (at the gate).
    *   **Weekends (Sat-Sun):** $15 (online day before), $20 (online same-day), $25 (at the gate).
    *   Kids 3 and under get in FREE! 🎉

## 2. Chilliwack Tulip Festival

*   **When?** Mark your calendar for **April 4th to May 5th, 2025**.
    *   **Hours:** Mon-Fri: 10:00 AM - 6:30 PM // Weekends: 6:00 AM - 6:30 PM (Yep, early start for you keen photographers wanting that golden hour light!)
*   📍 **Location:** You'll find this one at **5039 Lougheed Hwy., Agassiz, BC**. *(Heads up: This address is the same as the Harrison festival below - it seems Harrison is the current branding for the event at this location, which might have previously been more associated with Chilliwack)*.
*   **What's the big deal?** Another massive display! Expect over **50 different kinds** of tulips, totalling around **10 million** flowers. The best part? The fields are set against some absolutely *stunning* mountain scenery. Talk about picture-perfect! 🏔️🌷

## 3. Harrison Tulip Festival (Onos Farms / Lakeland Flowers)

*   **When?** Catch this one from **April 12th to May 11th, 2025**.
*   📍 **Location:** Also in Agassiz, specifically at **Onos Farms, 5039 Lougheed Hwy**. **Super important note:** The parking entrance is actually on **Cameron Rd**! Don't miss that sign. *(This is also a Lakeland Flowers event, taking over the well-known Agassiz fields)*.
*   **What's the big deal?** Okay, Harrison seems to be pulling out *all* the stops this year!
    *   **Flower Power:** We're talking over **40 acres** planted with more than **12 MILLION** bulbs! That's mostly tulips (over 100 varieties!), but they've also got hyacinths and double daffodils mixed in. Spring flower dream, basically.
    *   **"Secret Garden":** There's a *new* 4-acre display garden featuring a mix of tulips, muscari (grape hyacinths - those cute little blue ones!), fritillaria (crown imperials) and more. Sounds super pretty and unique!
    *   **Insta-Ready Ops:** Seriously, bring your camera or make sure your phone is charged! They've scattered fun photo props throughout the fields – think colourful bikes, a *mini grand piano* (!!), and giant *klompen* (those classic Dutch wooden shoes). Plus, they've added **four new "golden path" photo spots** this year that sound like they'll make your pics extra bright! ✨ Bring your camera!
    *   **More Dutch Fun:** Need some wooden shoes? There's even a *schoenen winkel* (Dutch shoe shop)!
    *   **Sounds & Sights:** On certain evenings (check their schedule!), you can enjoy live music from local pianists. Plus, catch live painting demos on April 26th and May 3rd! 🎨🎹
    *   **Food & Flowers To-Go:** Feel free to pack your own picnic to enjoy amongst the blooms! If you don't pack snacks, no worries – **food trucks** are on site 7 days a week, ensuring you stay fueled during your floral adventure. And yes, you can buy bunches of **fresh-cut tulips** to bring a piece of the festival home with you! 💐

So there you have it! Proof that Vancouver's spring is about *way* more than just cherry blossoms (though we love them too!). These tulip festivals look absolutely incredible and are totally worth the drive.

My advice? Check their official websites closer to the dates (like "Lakeland Flowers Abbotsford" and "Harrison Tulip Festival" / "Lakeland Flowers Harrison") for the absolute latest info, bloom status updates (check their Instagrams too!), and definitely try to **buy those tickets online** if you can.

Happy tulip hunting, friends! Let me know if you end up going! 😊
