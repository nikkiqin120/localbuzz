## 🚗 Getting There & Away: Coachella 2025 Transport Tips

Getting in and out can be part of the adventure (or headache!) at **Coachella 2025**. Here's the lowdown:

*   **Shuttle Power:** Honestly, if you can swing it, the **Shuttle is king!** 👑 It drops you off super close to the venue entrance – we're talking less than a 10-minute walk. Super convenient for navigating the festival grounds.
*   **Driving + Preferred Parking:** We went this route for **Coachella 2025**.
    *   **Navigation:** Use the **Coachella 2025** app's detailed traffic map! You'll need to approach via Monroe St, heading south, then turn onto E Ave 49 following the specific **Coachella 2025** traffic plan.
    *   **Traffic:** Expect delays! Add an extra 20-30 minutes to your GPS estimate, especially heading in during peak times.
    *   **Timing:** We arrived around 5 PM each day and didn't encounter the dreaded "Preferred Parking full" situation during **Coachella 2025** Weekend 1. Fingers crossed it stays that way for you! 🤞
    *   **The Walk:** Be prepared – even Preferred Parking involves a walk of about 20 minutes to the actual **Coachella 2025** entrance.
    *   **Exiting:** We aimed to leave about an hour before the final headliner finished each night and got out smoothly. The last day we left a bit later, and it took about 30 minutes just to exit the parking lot. Overall, manageable for the **Coachella 2025** scale.

## 🎒 Essential Gear: What to Pack for Coachella 2025

Pack smart, not heavy for your **Coachella 2025** adventure! Here's what saved us:

*   **😷 Mask / Bandana:** Crucial! There's a sandy path on the way in, and by Weekend 2 of **Coachella 2025**, the grass fields will likely be kicked up into a dust bowl. Protect your lungs!
*   **🌡️ Survival Blanket:** These tiny packs are lifesavers. Use it as a ground cover to sit on during the day, and wrap up in it when the desert temperature drops at night. Multi-purpose FTW!
*   **🧥 Light Jacket:** Don't underestimate the evening chill at **Coachella 2025**! Temperatures can dip below 20°C (68°F). Bring a layer you can easily carry.
*   **☀️ Sun Protection:** Apply sunscreen *before* you leave. Good news: there are free sunscreen dispensers inside the **Coachella 2025** venue if you need a top-up.

## 🏜️ Navigating the Grounds: Coachella 2025 Stages & Strategy

The **Coachella 2025** venue is huge, but manageable with a plan:

*   **App Map is Key:** Seriously, familiarize yourself with the map on the **Coachella 2025** app. It's your best friend for finding stages, restrooms, and food. 🗺️
*   **Main Stages:** The main **Coachella Stage** and the **Outdoor Theatre** are relatively close together, making it easy to hop between sets there.
*   **Sahara Tent:** This semi-indoor stage is on the opposite side from the main stage. Expect a walk of about 10 minutes across the **Coachella 2025** field to get there.
*   **Smaller Stages (Sonora, Heineken House):** These intimate venues have capacity limits and often require queuing. If a must-see artist for **Coachella 2025** is playing there, factor in extra time to line up. ⏳
*   **Punctuality:** **Coachella 2025** shows generally start on time, rarely delayed more than five minutes.
*   **Viewing Strategy:** Our personal take? Either get there early to snag a spot near the front, OR hang back further out, enjoy the vibes, see the whole stage (even if people are tiny dots), and actually hear properly. Getting stuck in the middle often means staring at the back of someone tall's head. 👀

## 🥪 Food & Drinks: Stay Fueled & Hydrated at Coachella 2025

You won't go hungry or thirsty at **Coachella 2025**, but be prepared for festival prices:

*   **Availability:** Food stalls are scattered everywhere, so finding eats is easy across the **Coachella 2025** grounds.
*   **Variety & Taste:** Lots of options, and the quality is generally decent! Don't miss the signature **Fresh Squeezed Lemonade** 🍋 – it's iconic at **Coachella 2025** (though pricey).
*   **Cost:** Expect $$$ prices. A main dish will run you about $20-30 USD. That famous lemonade is around $17.
*   **Water:** Thankfully, bottled water is reasonably priced at a standard $2 across the venue.
*   **Refill Stations:** Plenty of free water refill stations are available – bring your own reusable bottle! Staying hydrated is key for the **Coachella 2025** desert climate. 💧

## 🛍️ Merch Haul: Coachella 2025 Pro Tips

Planning to grab some souvenirs from **Coachella 2025**? Read this first:

*   **BYOB (Bring Your Own Bag!):** They **do not** provide shopping bags at the merch tents. Plan ahead!
    *   Rent a locker box for storage.
    *   Buy one of the official **Coachella 2025** tote bags *first*.
    *   Bring your own foldable tote bag.
*   **Tent Locations:** Know that general **Coachella 2025** merch and specific artist merch are usually sold in **two different large tents**. Check the map! 👕
