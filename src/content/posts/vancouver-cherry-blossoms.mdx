# 🌸 Now's the Perfect Time — Vancouver Cherry Blossom Spots in Full Bloom!

The cherry blossoms across Metro Vancouver are in full swing! If you're looking for the best places to catch them this weekend, here's your ultimate sakura guide with local favorites, photo tips, and secret corners.

## 🌸 Vancouver

### 📍 Graveley St & Windermere St  
Arguably **the most famous cherry blossom street** in Metro Vancouver.  
Every spring, this street gets packed with visitors and photographers. Narrow and quiet, the road is flanked by cherry trees that form a pink tunnel—absolutely stunning for photos!  
**Pro tip**: Bring a drone for breathtaking aerial shots with the Brentwood skyline in the background.

### 📍 Graveley St between Lillooet St and Rupert St  
Just a few blocks away from the "main" cherry street, this stretch is far less crowded but just as scenic. A peaceful detour for those seeking quieter beauty.

### 📍 Queen Elizabeth Park  
Right near the entrance, there's a wide open area of blooming sakura—ideal for picnics, portraits, and even weddings!  
If you're looking to lounge under a tree and enjoy the soft breeze with family or friends, this is the place.

## 🌸 Burnaby

### 📍 Lou Moro Park  
Walk from the tennis courts down toward the lake—you'll find plenty of **hidden cherry blossom gems**.  
This spot was where we spent the **longest time taking photos**. Large mature cherry trees, quiet streets, and Ridge Dr + Malibu Dr nearby also offer some of the best local sakura vibes—without the crowds.

---

## 🌸 Brentwood

### 📍 Cherry Blossom Garden  
Truly one of **Metro Vancouver's cherry blossom highlights**!  
Five neat rows of sakura trees create a magical pink corridor, tucked away from busy roads.  
**Heads-up**: It's popular. Expect a crowd, and be ready to hunt for creative angles. Nearby high-rises may cast shadows in the afternoon.

### 📍 Brentlawn Dr & Fairlawn Dr  
Just a short walk from Brentwood Mall, this residential area offers some lovely, quiet cherry-lined streets.  
**Bonus**: On clear days, you can capture cherry blossoms with snowy mountain backdrops. Perfect for a casual stroll with kids or pets!

## 🌸 Metrotown

### 📍 Imperial St & Randolph St  
This hidden gem is tucked in a quiet neighborhood. With fewer people and less road traffic, you'll often find the ground **covered in fallen petals**—like a real-life anime scene.

---

## 🌸 Downtown

### 📍 David Lam Park  
A classic cherry blossom spot that also hosts events during the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival.  
Lay out a blanket, enjoy a picnic, and wander through the mini-market—feels just like Japan!

### 📍 Waterfront Station to Gastown  
Take a stroll from the station toward the harbor. Cherry blossoms lining the seawall, framed by urban scenery, give off a totally cinematic vibe.  
**Cityscape meets nature**—perfect for street photography.

---

## 🌸 North Vancouver

### 📍 Waterfront Park  
An underrated gem! The cherry trees here are **lower than most**, making them great for portraits (especially with kids).  
There's also a large play area nearby—imagine capturing a photo of your little one on a swing or seesaw with pink blossoms in the background. Magical!  
⚠️ Small note: Let's respect the trees—please don't break or shake branches to force a "petal shower."
